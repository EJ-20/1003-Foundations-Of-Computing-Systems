You need to be using a Unix/Linux/MacOS environment to use GREP.

It's not part of Windows/Chrome OS/Android/IOS and so on.

GREP is not formally part of the course, so don't worry if you are not able to use it right now.

For your own development as a computer scientist it is something worth learning when you next have the opportunity to use a labnet machine.

Simple examples, using the included text files:
-----------------------------------------------

grep -c "Mrs. Bennet" Pride\ and\ Prejudice.txt 

grep -n "picture" Shopping\ List.txt

grep -n "fram.*" Shopping\ List.txt

grep -n ".\{0,5\}board." Shopping\ List.txt
